		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_BUILDINGS_NILOMETER_TEXT">
			<Text>The Nilometer was an Egyptian measurement device designed to benchmark the water levels of the Nile River during the annual flood season. The Egyptians relied on the Nile to overrun the surrounding flood plains each year in order to deposit silt for fertilization, but too much water would destroy the harvesting infrastructure, while too little water could cause a widespread famine. The Egyptians used the Nilometer flood readings to determine the appropriate level of taxes to be levied against the farmers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Nilometer itself typically consisted of either a standing column or a descending flight of stairs leading into a well that was channeled from the river. Both configurations featured incremental markings to indicate the depth of the water, and the Egyptians kept detailed records for year-to-year comparison. One of the oldest surviving examples of the Nilometer stands today on the island of Roda in Cairo, believed to have been constructed in the 9th century AD by the Persian astronomer Alfraganus.</Text>

Muwatallis is most famously known as the Hittite king who fought against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II for greater control of Syria at the epic Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC. Fought near the site of the ancient city of Kadesh, the battle is notable for the sheer number of Chariots involved, said to have numbered in the thousands.

Contemporary archaeologists have discovered a number of pivotal advancements made by the Sumerians during their history, particularly in the areas of agriculture, mathematics and writing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Known for utilizing advanced agricultural practices including the use of irrigation and year-round crop cultivation, the Sumerians took advantage of the rich soil found on the Fertile Crescent to establish permanent settlements in the region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps more importantly, the Sumerians developed one of the world's first written languages, "Cuneiform," which archaeologists have discovered on hundreds of clay tablets unearthed at sites throughout the area.

			<Text>Reaching the height of power around 1500 BC, the empire of the Hittites spanned large swaths of land in Anatolia (Asia Minor) and parts of Syria bordering the Egyptian kingdom. Thought to have been founded by Hattusili I c. 1700 BC, the Hittites would face an ebb and flow of military successes and defeats for over 500 years. Known for their successful use of chariots, the Hittites conquered a number of neighboring rivals only to reach a stalemate with the Egyptians at the renowned Battle of Kadesh, possibly the largest Chariot battle in history. </Text>
