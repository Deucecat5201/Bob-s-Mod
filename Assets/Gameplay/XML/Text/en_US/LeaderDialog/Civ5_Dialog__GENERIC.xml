		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_HOSTILE_WE_ATTACKED_YOUR_MINOR_1">
			<Text>I thought you might like to know that I've launched an invasion of one of your little pet states. The lands of {@1_MinorCivName} will make a fine addition to my own.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_HOSTILE_WE_ATTACKED_YOUR_MINOR_2">
			<Text>Oops, it seems I've attacked your little friend {@1_MinorCivName}. Care to do something about it?</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_WE_ATTACKED_YOUR_MINOR_1">
			<Text>It's come to my attention that I may have attacked {@1_MinorCivName}, a city-state under your protection. While it was not my goal to be at odds with your empire, this was deemed a necessary course of action.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_WE_ATTACKED_YOUR_MINOR_2">
			<Text>I've been informed that my empire has commenced an attack on {@1_MinorCivName}. I assure you, this was not on purpose, and hope that this does not serve to drive us apart.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_EMBASSY_EXCHANGE_1">

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BULLIED_PROTECTED_CITY_STATE_1">
			<Text>Your bullying of {@1_MinorCivName} is intolerable. I demand that you refrain from squeezing tribute out of city-states under my protection.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BULLIED_PROTECTED_CITY_STATE_2">
			<Text>I heard about what you did to {@1_MinorCivName}.  Did you not realize they are under my protection?  Do not provoke me further.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_HOSTILE_WE_BULLIED_YOUR_MINOR_1">
			<Text>We asked {@1_MinorCivName} for a tribute recently and they gave in. You promised to protect them from such things, but we both know you cannot back that up.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_HOSTILE_WE_BULLIED_YOUR_MINOR_2">
			<Text>Your little friend {@1_MinorCivName} is so easy to push around. They gave in to our tribute demands, and I don't believe you are in a position to do anything about it.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_WE_BULLIED_YOUR_MINOR_1">
			<Text>It's come to my attention that I may have bullied {@1_MinorCivName}, which is under your protection. You do not put their needs above mine, I hope.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_WE_BULLIED_YOUR_MINOR_2">
			<Text>I've been informed that my armies have taken tribute from {@1_MinorCivName}, a city-state under your protection. I assure you, this was quite unintentional, and I hope that this does not serve to drive us apart.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_SAME_POLICIES_AUTOCRACY_1">
			<Text>Welcome great emperor! I'm pleased to see you have also chosen to follow the path of Autocracy. May we work together to ensure that only the very strongest nations survive to achieve true greatness!</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_CAUGHT_YOUR_SPY_HOSTILE_1">
			<Text>How did one of your filthy agents somehow steal one of our basic technological secrets? These may be the last words we speak in peace.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_CAUGHT_YOUR_SPY_FRIENDLY_1">

			<Text>As you request, our agents will not conduct operations in your territory.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_RESPONSE_STOP_SPYING_NO_1">
			<Text>Our agents help keep our civilization safe from all threats, including you. They operate as we need them to, not as you ask.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_RESPONSE_WARNED_ABOUT_INTRIGUE_1">
			<Text>Thank you for bringing this {@1_CivAdjective} plot to our attention. With this warning, we will be ready for whatever they may try. Your generous aid will be remembered.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_RESPONSE_SHARE_INTRIGUE_DECEPTION_1">

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_KILLED_YOUR_SPY_1">
			<Text>We killed your spy as it was trying to steal from us. From my experience, it is far less dangerous to read a book and try to learn something yourself.</Text>
		</Row>

			<Text>I regret any confusion caused by our late agent's recent activity. Please let any hostile feelings rest with the deceased operative.</Text>

			<Text>As you wish, we will stop looking for artifacts within your borders.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_GENERIC_RESPONSE_HUMAN_STOP_DIGGING_BAD_1">
